# 🥁 Drum Kit Web App

A fun and interactive **Drum Kit** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This project was created for **learning purposes** as part of a **Udemy web development course**, and I plan to **improve and modify it every week** by adding new features and design enhancements.

## 🧠 Learning Purpose

This project is part of my **learning journey** through a **Udemy course on web development**.  
The goal was to understand how to use **JavaScript events**, **audio objects**, and **DOM manipulation** to build an interactive web app.

I’ll continue to:
- Refactor and clean the code 🧹  
- Add new drum sounds and animations 🎶  
- Improve responsiveness 📱  
- Experiment with different UI/UX styles 🎨
